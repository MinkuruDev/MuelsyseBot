It's no fair,
I don't wanna have to wake up from this daydream, you're my day-day dream.
It's no fair,
I don't wanna have to wake-wake from this daydream, you're my day-ay-ay-ay dream.

Anywhere I go, I'll miss you.
Anywhere I go–

Anywhere I go, I'll miss you.
Anywhere I– [×2]

Anywhere I go, I'll miss you.
Anywhere I go–

Anywhere I– [×2]
Anywhere I go, I'll miss you.

It's no fair,
I don't wanna have to wake-wake from this daydream, you're my daydream.
It's no fair,
I don't wanna have to wake up from this daydream, you're my daydream.

It's no fair,
I don't wanna have to wake up from this day-day dream, you're my day-day dream
It's no fair,
I don't wanna have to wake up from this daydream, you're my daydream.

Anywhere– [×2]
Anywhere I go.

Anywhere– [×2]
Anywhere I go, I'll miss you.

Anywhere– [×2]
Anywhere I go.
Will you sing along to all my bittersweet melodies?

No, I still can't seem to– [×3]
No, I still can't seem–

No, I still can't seem to
sing more than blues when it's time for my verse.
It's true that I need you
to turn my blues into bursting fireworks.
You're the one,
the setting sun I'll long for, 'til kingdom come.
I'm wishing I could speed through
all of the days that we have to be apart.
You fade like
the sunset.
You stay light
(like) the sunset.

Anywhere– [×2]
Anywhere I go, (I miss you.)
[×3]
